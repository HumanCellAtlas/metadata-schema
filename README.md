# The Human Cell Atlas Metadata Standards and Schema

This repo contains documentation, schemas, and examples for the HCA metadata standard.
 
## Documentation

Most documentation is available in the `docs/` directory, including the following:

- High-level overview of the **structure** of the HCA metadata standards.
- Rationale for the **design and implementation choices** of the HCA metadata standards.
- **Evolution principles and update process** for the HCA metadata standards.
- Information for **how to contribute** to the HCA metadata standards.

The **metadata design principles** can be read in the [Metadata schema lifecycle doc](docs/Metadata_schema_lifecycle_doc.md).

Details on **how to contribute** to the metadata schema standards are described in the [contributing.md](docs/contributing.md) doc.

## Metadata schemas

All metadata JSON schemas are available for browsing in the `json_schema/` directory. Schemas are also hosted at [schema.humancellatlas.org](https://schema.humancellatlas.org/a).

When required, extensions to base JSON schemas have been developed and are located in the `json_schema_extensions/` directory.

## Metadata examples

The `examples/` directory contains a number of example JSON files and spreadsheets (both filled and empty) to illustrate how the HCA metadata standards are implemented.

## Scripts

Any scripts - *e.g.* those required for automatic testing, derivation of template spreadsheets - are located in the `src/` directory.
