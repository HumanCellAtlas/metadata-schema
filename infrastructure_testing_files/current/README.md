# The Human Cell Atlas Metadata Standards: Metadata Spreadsheets for Integration Tests

This directory (_metadata-schema/infrastructure_testing_files/current_) contains the latest metadata spreadsheets for DCP-wide integration tests.

`dcp_integration_test_metadata_1_optimus_10X_bundle.xlsx`

**This is the DCP-wide integration test spreadsheet.** Contains a small file set from the dataset: 4k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor, a Single Cell Gene Expression Dataset by Cell Ranger 2.1.0. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were taken from a healthy donor (same donor as pbmc8k). PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (~1pg RNA/cell). Data/Analysis can be found here https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/2.1.0/pbmc4k and all data is licensed under the creative commons attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This test also contains extensive metadata for browser testing. Metadata is fabricated. Project label: "10x 1 Run Integration Test"

`dcp_integration_test_metadata_1_SS2_bundle.xlsx`

**This is the DCP-wide integration test spreadsheet.** Contains a small file set (SRR3562314) from the dataset 'Single cell transcriptome analysis of human pancreas' to speed up analysis. This test also contains extensive metadata for browser testing. Metadata is fabricated. Where possible, example values from the metadata schema are used. Project label: "SS2 1 Cell Integration Test"
