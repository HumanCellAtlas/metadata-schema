sample	A sample is an entity level object.  It exists as a separate file in a data bundle			
A sample contains information on the biosample that was sequenced or imaged.  This includes donor, body part, and anything that comes between removing the sample from a body and the assay.				
				
Field Name	source	Priority	Type	Description
core	ingest	Required	core module	The schema definition for a sample
id	ingest	Required	local ID	A unique ID for this sample
project_id	ingest	Required	local ID	The id field of the project that this connects to
submitter_id	ingest	High	local ID	ID of contact who first submitted project
submit_date	ingest	High	date	When project was first submitted to database.
updater_id	ingest	High	local ID	ID of contact who last updated project
update_date	ingest	High	date	When project was last updated
				
name	submitter	High	text	A short descriptive name for sample.  Should be enough to distinguish it from other samples in the project
title	submitter	Optional	text	A descriptive phrase or sentence, ideally about 60 characters.
donor	submitter	Required	module	Information on the donor that the sample came from.
protocol_ids	submitter	Optional	array of protocol IDs	IDs or all protocols used by sample.  Should be protocols found in project.protocol  
				
organ	submitter	Required	ontology	The organ that the sample came from.  "Blood" and "connective tissue" count as organs.
body_part	submitter	Required	ontology	A more detailed position within the organ where body came from.
cell_cycle	submitter	Optional	ontology	If sample is synchronized growing cells or a cell in a known phase of cell cycle, put which phase here
preservation	submitter	Optional	module	State of body_part at collection and how it was preserved after removal.
supplementary_files	submitter	Optional	array of file/url	Sample level supplementary files.
well	submitter	Optional	module	If sample was isolated in a well in plate (or fluidics chip), information about that
disassociation_protocol	submitter	Optional	protocol	How body part was treated to disassociate it into cells that can float individually in solution in sorter or microfluidics device.
enrichment	submitter	Optional	array of module	How cells were enriched for specific type or to weed out common types after disassociation.
total_estimated_cells	submitter	Optional	number	Total estimated number of cells in sample.  May be 1 for well based assays.
culture_type	submitter	High	CV	either "tissue," "primary culture," "cell_line," "differentiation," or "organoid."
cell_line	submitter	Optional	module	Description of cell line if any that this came from.
brain	submitter	Optional	module	Detailed positional information if it is a brain sample
heart	submitter	Optional	module	Detailed positional information if it is a heart sample
				
biosd_sample	ext DB	Optional	ext ID	EBI biosample ID
ena_sample	ext DB	Optional	ext ID	European nucleotide archive sample ID
geo_sample	ext DB	Optional	ext ID	NCBI GEO sample accession
ncbi_biosample	ext DB	Optional	ext ID	NCBI biosample ID
				
characteristics_*	submitter	Optional	text	FIelds that begin with sample.characteristics_ can contain any value, and the field name can be anything after the prefix
