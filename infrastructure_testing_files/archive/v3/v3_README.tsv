This spreadsheet describes the metadata fields for use in the ingest side of the Human Cell Atlas project.		
These fields will occur in several contexts - as columns in spreadsheets and as fields of objects in json and other computer langauges		
The fields are named using a dotted notation:   object.subobject.field.  There is a separate tab for each object.  		
The names use underbar rather than space or dash as a separator to be compatible with most computer languages		
		
Here's an explanation of the tabs of this spreadsheet:		
	README	This tab, hopefully useful overview information
	.core	Object id and schema - a subobject that appears in all modules
		
	The next three sheets describe the entity level modules, ones that are very high level in the EBI database, and are represented as separate json files in bundles.	
	project	Description of project level fields, ones associated with all samples
	sample	Information about where the sample came from including donor and body part, and treatments
	assay	Information relevant to how RNA expression levels were assayed 
		
	The following modules are subobjects that only appear as fields within some entities.	
	.contact	Information about who produced the data set. An array called contacts[] of these is embedded in the project object.
	.cell_line	Information about any cell lines used
	.death	Information about donor's death circumstances
	.donor	Information about an organ or biopsy donor
	.enrichment	How sample was enriched for certain cell types
	.imaging	Information on imaging type RNA quantification assays
	.preservation	How sample is preserved
	.protocol	Relatively long free text fields that describe how something was done.
	.publication	Information about a paper or other pubication
	.rna	Information about how RNA was treated before sequencing
	.seq	Information about sequencing
	.single_cell	Information about how cells were separated and set up for individual sequencing
	.well	Information about the well and plate sample is in for plate and fluidics chip based assays
		
	These sheets describe the codes used in certain fields of the module sheets.	
	Ontologies	Highlights fields that are associated with ontologies.
	Priority Code	Explains the priority column used in various sheets - required, optional etc.
	Type Code	Explains the type column used in various sheets - string, number, etc.
	Source Code	Explains the submitter column used in various sheets - submitter, ingest,  etc.
