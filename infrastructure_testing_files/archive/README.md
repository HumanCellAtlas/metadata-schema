# The Human Cell Atlas Metadata Standards: Filled Example Metadata Spreadsheets

This directory (_metadata-schema/infrastructure_testing_files/archive_) contains the archived metadata spreadsheets from DCP-wide integration tests. File names are kept the same and a time stamp dd/mm/yy is added to the end of the file following an underscore.


These files were in use fillowing v5 -> latest versioning shift. They were hosted at from https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp/tree/master/tests/fixtures/datasets. We should now point tests at the metadata repo and keep this up to date.
