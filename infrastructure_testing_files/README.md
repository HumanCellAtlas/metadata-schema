## Test data

The spreadsheet at the root of this folder represents a full hca project, with all possible entities included (Except imaging: WIP)

This spreadsheet will be used to test metadata moving through ingest and will be updated on every release to the integration environment (Every thursday)

The actual data is mock data and is stored at the hca-util upload area named `test-data-area`

Instructions on generating the mock data coming soon
