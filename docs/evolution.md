This document describes the principles and standards by which the HCA metadata schema will evolve. Version 1.0 of this document can be found in the [HCA metadata lifecycle and versioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUVpYDLu2AxmxRw2ZUMM-jpKNxQudJbznNyNRp35nLc/edit#heading=h.6p3dwsx7c3hb) document on Google Drive. The v2.0 document here includes HCA schema design principles and standards and the semantics for versioning and updating these schema. More detailed discussion of the format and syntax of the metadata schema and their instantiation can be found in the complementary [Metadata schema structure specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxQj7BfM8HHgD4ilm4dlvZuZATfJkNC5s_-TUoA4lYA/edit?ts=59b16455) document on Google Drive. The metadata working group will review this process on a yearly basis and ensure it is meeting the needs of the working group. If at any point the process becomes problematic, changes should be made to ensure metadata update is not a blocker for the consortium as a whole.
