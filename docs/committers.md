## General steps of the update process

1. **Receive request for update to the metadata standard.** A person (the "Contributor") can suggest changes to the metadata standards via three main routes:
    1. Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema/issues/new?template=schema_update.md) on the metadata-schema GitHub repo
    1. Email the HCA DCP helpdesk at [data-help@humancellaltas.org](mailto:data-help@humancellaltas.org)
    1. Make a pull request against the develop branch of the metadata-schema GitHub repo

    There are two main types of suggestions: (1) **updates** to existing schemas and (2) addition of **new** schema(s).

    1. To request an **update** to an existing schema, the following pieces of information are required:

        1. For which schema is a change/update being suggested?
        1. What should the change/update be?
        1. What new field(s) need to be added?
            - Details for requesting **new field(s)** outlined below
        1. Why is the change requested?

    1. To request a **new** schema, the following pieces of information are required:

        1. What is the proposed name of the new schema?
        1. What field(s) should the new schema contain?
            - Details for requesting **new field(s)** outlined below
        1. Why is the new schema needed? Specifically, why does the current metadata standard not meet your need?
    
    For **each new field** requested, the following pieces of information are required:
    
    1. Field name
    1. Field description
    1. Whether the field should be optional or required
    1. An example valid value for this field
    1. If this field needs a controlled vocabulary or ontology. If yes, what those values should be or which ontology should be followed.
    
    If the suggested update comes in the form of a pull request, the above information should be self-evident between the JSON schema itself and the pull request message. If this isnâ€™t clear either from the pull request or the message sent through email or git, then the assigned committer will seek clarification before continuing to step 3.

1. **Assign Committer to review the suggestion.** A person (the "Committer") with commit rights on the metadata-schema repo will be assigned to each suggestion (issue/email/PR). The Committer will be responsible for reviewing the suggestion, noting any consequences of the suggestion, contacting appropriate HCA teams for feedback, and making announcements to ensure the whole community has an opportunity to provide input. 

1. **Make pull request if one does not exist.** If the suggestion came in the form of a GitHub issue or email, then the Committer needs to make the suggested update and a pull request against develop. If the Contributor has a GitHub account, they should be encouraged to make the suggested update and a pull request. When a pull request is made, a test suite of tools will automatically run that validates the updates. 

    **NB** Currently this test suite of tools is not complete, and the tools that do exist must be run manually by the Reviewer.

1. **Annotate the pull request (version, stability) and run unit tests.** The Committer should classify the suggested update by the type of version change (major, minor, patch) and the stability category (high, medium, or low). These classifications can be indicated in the pull request description. Specifically, the version change classification will be indicated in the `update_log.csv` file. The Committer should also ensure the metadata-schema repo unit tests have been run and pass. Example spreadsheets and JSON documents will potentially need to be updated.

1. **Notify community about the update request.** The Committer should announce the suggested update/PR on the #hca-metadata and #dcp Slack channels so everyone can have an opportunity to comment over the time frame specified by the combination of stability level and version change. The Committer should also tag specific developers who could be impacted by the change. 

1. **Start the community review period.** The Committer starts the clock on the review period as indicated by the [update acceptance process](schema-update-acceptance-process). The Committer and any other assigned internal reviewers ("Reviewers") should actively respond to feedback on the proposed update, making any indicated changes in the pull request.

1. **Pre-release the update.** Once the review period is over, if the update is accepted then the Committer merges the pull request into develop following the [release process](release_process.md). The update is now considered "pre-released".

## Specific how-to for making changes

This section outlines steps for Committers to make suggested changes to the metadata schema via pull requests.

1. **Clone** the metadata-schema repository into your local environment (should only need to do this once).

        git clone git@github.com:HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema

1. **Navigate** to the metadata-schema repo.

        cd metadata-schema
    
1. **Switch** to the develop branch. All suggested changes should be based on the current develop branch.

        git checkout develop

1. **Make** and **switch** to a new working branch from develop. Name the branch following the convention: `initials-brief-desc-of-branch-scope`. Optionally, you can tag a GitHub issue (e.g. `Issue222`) or JIRA ticket (e.g. `HCA-123`) in the branch name.

        git checkout -b mf-new-mouse-module-Issue222

1. **Make** changes locally to the new working branch. After making changes, it is important to run the `src/schemas_are_valid_json.py` and `src/json_examples_validate_against_schema.py` scripts locally (which are also run by Travis CI after each commit). The first script checks whether each .json file in the `json_schema/` folder is valid JSON format. The second script attempts to validate example JSON files in the `schema_test_files/` directory against their corresponding schemas. Some of the JSON files are meant to fail (*e.g.* they are lacking required fields) and as their failure is expected behavior, the script should exit with status 0. Ensure both scripts exit with status 0 (you should see `Process finished with exit code 0` printed to the terminal) before committing changes. If either test fails, you will have to debug and fix the errors in the changes you made.

1. **Document** the changes in the `update_log.csv` file. This file is used by the automated release scripts to build the release changelog and increment the version number for the correct metadata schema. Unlike the changelog file, which is a running log of all metadata schema changes, the update_log file should only contain the documented changes for this branch, so the file should be empty apart from the header row when you first check out a new branch. An entry into `update_log.csv` should contain the path to the schema that was changed, the type of change (major, minor, or patch) and the description of the change that should go into the changelog, for example:

    `module/ontology/disease_ontology,patch,Fixed a typo in description of text field in disease_ontology. Fixes #000,,`

    Only list one schema per line and only list schemas that you have actually changed as the release script will automatically identify dependent schemas. If multiple schemas are being updated in a single PR, order the lines in the `update_log.csv` file with patch changes first, then minor, then major. Each line should end in a double comma, signifying the empty columns for version number and release date, which will be filled in by the release script. Not including the commas will cause the release script to fail. If there is a comma in the change message, the message needs to be quoted:

    `type/biomaterial/organoid,patch,"Added user friendly names for fields a, b, c and d",,`

    The change message should start with one of: *Added, Changed, Removed, Fixed, Deprecated, or Security*. These keywords are used in the changelog to classify types of changes.  

    ***New schemas only***

    1. If you added a new schema, **add** the name of the new schema in `json_schema/versions.json` in the correct location and with version number 0.0.0. For example, if you added a new biomaterial module `my_new_module`, your addition to the `versions.json` file would be:

           [...]
            "module": {
            "biomaterial": {
                [...],
                "my_new_module": 0.0.0
            },
            [...]

    1. The corresponding entry in the `update_log.csv` file should be marked a major version update so that the release script sets the version number of the new schema to `1.0.0`.

1. **Stage** and **commit** your changes to the working branch often. We recommend committing after making a few logically grouped changes to help track changes and to increase granularity for rollbacks (if needed). Use helpful/short messages in commit statements. If the commit specifically fixes/addresses a current GitHub issue, add the phrase "Fixes #000" to the commit statement, replacing "000" with the number of the issue. This phrase is handy because when the changes are merged into the master branch, it automatically closes the issue indicated.

        git add <changed files>
        git commit -m "Helpful commit message here. Fixes #000."
    
    Example commit message: "Created new mouse module with mouse-specific fields. Fixes #142."

1. **Push** the committed changes to the working branch.

        git checkout -b mf-new-mouse-module-Issue222

1. **Continue** to make, stage, and commit changes to the working branch - ensuring that the two Travis CI scripts pass - until you have completed and pushed all the changes within the scope of your new branch. In GitHub, **create** a pull request against the develop branch. In the comment section of the PR, write a general description of the changes followed by a bulleted list of the specific changes made in the files. 

1. **Request** additional Reviewer(s) in GitHub signalling that a PR needs to be reviewed. Announce the update on Slack. If the changes are ultimately approved by all indicated Reviewers and no objections were raised, one of the assigned Reviewers should run the pre-release process and merge the PR. **The Committer should not merge their own PR.** The Reviewer who merges the PR should then delete the branch unless otherwise specified by the Committer.

## Schema update acceptance process

There are three types of update acceptance verification: full, medium, and light. These three levels aim to facilitate agility for simple changes with few downstream dependencies but ensure that appropriate consideration is required for changes which are likely to trigger software updates. All reviews should consider what need is met by the requested change and what the impact of the change is on the existing systems, ensuring that updates which require major version changes also bring value to the DCP as a whole.

The *review timeframe* starts when the Committer responsible for the suggestion has announced it on the #hca-metadata and #dcp Slack channels. Weekend days and US/UK holidays do not count towards the review timeframe.

The *minimum reviewer number* is the minimum number of Reviewers who need to have seen and agreed to the change before the pull request can be accepted. This agreement must be active and result in at least +1 on the pull request thread. If a DCP team member or metadata-schema repo committer is the person who suggested the change, they should not be counted as one of the Reviewers needed for agreement.

Any *negative marks* (-1) against a proposal that can not be resolved in the allotted timeframe will need to extend the review process. The full details of this are described below. 

If during this process there is any disagreement about the best approach, the assigned Committer should work with the Contributor and other concerned third parties to find an acceptable solution for all concerned. If consensus still cannot be reached, a vote between the committers for the metadata-schema repo should decide the solution.

### Full acceptance

**Review timeframe**: 10 working days

**Minimum reviewer number**: 3 (a Committer, and two relevant third parties (Reviewer))

Full acceptance is used when making major version changes to high stability modules. This means the module being changed is likely to trigger a new software release for a DCP service. The DCP service which is most likely to be affected by any metadata update would be the Ingest Infrastructure. This should be a rare occurrence. The DCP metadata and code should have a clear separation of concerns and the dependencies between the two should be minimal. That being said, the ingest infrastructure, in particular, needs some knowledge of the metadata structure in order to enable ID fields to be assigned and to allow the system to know the relationships between the submitted entities. Any module which contains these fields must be considered high stability.

This process should take 10 working days. The assigned Committer should identify at least two developers from the DCP team to review the change and comment as well as themselves. If the Contributor making the suggestion was a developer from a DCP team, the two Reviewers should be other DCP developers. 

### Medium acceptance

**Review timeframe**: 120 hours (5 working days)

**Minimum reviewer number**: 2 (a Committer and one relevant third party (Reviewer))

Medium acceptance is the process used for major version changes to medium stability modules and minor version changes to both high and medium stability modules. 

Generally this is a suitable acceptance process for changes which donâ€™t require DCP software updates but are likely to affect how the metadata can be queried from a scientific perspective. It is expected for these types of updates to happen more frequently than those which require full acceptance as they will concerns fields with scientific meaning. New experiments and changes in technology may require new fields or changes to existing fields.

The process should take 5 working days. The assigned Committer should identify at least one interested third party (Reviewer) from the secondary and tertiary analysis groups to provide review. As before, if the Contributor is a member of the secondary or tertiary analysis group, another person should be selected as the Reviewer.

### Light acceptance

**Review timeframe**: 72 hours (3 working days)

**Minimum reviewer number**: 1 (a committer)

Light acceptance is the process used for all patch versions, regardless of stability and for all changes to low stability modules.

Light acceptance is lightweight process which allows rapid iteration for new technologies where the requirements are not precisely defined and the processes are changing quickly.  Downstream users of this data should be aware that the metadata is changing rapidly and understand any dependencies they create on specific structures will be broken in future.

The process should take 3 working days. The assigned Committer does not need to recruit an additional Reviewer though should ensure that as many people as possible have seen the suggestion via Slack messages or GitHub notifications.

| | Major version | Minor Version  | Patch version |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| High Stability | Full acceptance | Medium acceptance | Light acceptance |
| Medium Stability | Medium acceptance | Medium acceptance | Light acceptance |
| Low Stability | Light acceptance | Light acceptance | Light acceptance |

### How to manage negative marks against a suggested change.

Hopefully negative marks or a lack of consensus will be very rare occurrence but this process does contain the possibility of disagreement on the best solution. 

For proposed changes where consensus looks unlikely, as the review deadline looms (~ 1 day before if possible), the assigned committer should schedule a phone call to discuss the issue with the interested parties. If no consensus can be reached, the process should be extended by 5 working days for more interaction. At the end of these 5 days, if no consensus has been reached, the two possible solutions should be presented to the committers and a vote should be called with the committers to the metadata-schemas repo, the solution with most votes being taken forward.

## Committer guidelines

1. *Do not merge your own PR.* This ensures that at least one other person has reviewed the suggested changes and has approved them. 
    1. Exception 1: For PRs that affect documentation only, the same person can make/merge the PR if another person with commit privileges specifically approves it using the GitHub approval mechanism.
    1. Exception 2: A reviewer can merges changes they made by running the `release_prepare.py` script.
1. *Be clear and descriptive in PR comments/commits.* 
    1. Refer to GitHub issues that the PR addresses by adding `Fixes #000` to at least 1 commit statement in the PR (where 000 is replaced by the actual GitHub issue number). 
    1. Tag a specific person if the PR addresses their issue or if the change affects their work.
    1. Include reasoning behind changes that could be controversial (e.g. reason why a field name changes, but no reason needed to fix a typo in a field description).
