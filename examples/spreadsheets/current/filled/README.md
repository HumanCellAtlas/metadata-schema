# The Human Cell Atlas Metadata Standards: Filled Example Metadata Spreadsheets

This directory contains example metadata spreadsheets that are filled with valid metadata.

`glioblastoma_100cells.xlsx`

This spreadsheet contains metadata for a published SmartSeq2 experiment looking at diffuse neoplastic infiltrating cells at the migrating front of human glioblastoma. The original dataset sequenced about 3500 cells. This example spreadsheet contains metadata for a subset of 100 of these cells (used for scale-testing DCP infrastructure).
