# Examples of metadata spreadsheets

This directory contains examples of metadata spreadsheets that we currently use for metadata collection. There are 2 folders:
- `filled`: Contains examples of simplified experiments present in the HCA, based on library preparation technology (10x or SS2). Also contains graphs that show the experiments visually.
- `template`: Empty versions of the spreadsheets for the user to try and fill if they want.

**Disclaimer**: These are just examples, the HCA is capable of representing a wider set of experiments and collect more metadata from experiments.

For any question, please contact the [wrangler team](mailto:wrangler-team@data.humancellatlas.org).
