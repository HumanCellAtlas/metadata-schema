#### `glioblastoma_2assay_data_protocol_error.xlsx`

Same as `glioblastoma_2assay_data.xlsx` but with (1) protocol IDs entered in the protocol_ids column on the sequencing_process tab and (2) sequencing protocol entry in the protocol tab. This is the correct form of this spreadsheet and **should not** be failing.

#### `glioblastoma_2assay_data.xlsx`

Same as `glioblastoma_2assay_data_protocol_error.xlsx` but missing (1) protocol IDs entered in the protocol_ids column on the sequencing_process tab and (2) sequencing protocol entry in the protocol tab. This is the incorrect form of this spreadsheet and **should** be failing.

#### `glioblastoma_v5_plainHeaders_large_7000cells.xlsx`

A version of the glioblastoma spreadsheet in which the number of cells sequenced has been artificially duplicated. This spreadsheet serves as a stress test. 

#### `glioblastoma_v5_plainHeaders_medium_1000cells.xlsxz`

A version of the glioblastoma spreadsheet in which the number of cells sequenced has been decreased to 1000. This spreadsheet serves as a test for secondary analysis pipelines. 

#### `glioblastoma_v5_plainHeaders_real_3500cells.xlsx`

The real version of the glioblastoma spreadsheet. 

#### `glioblastoma_v5_plainHeaders_small_2cells.xlsx`

A version of the glioblastoma spreadsheet in which the number of cells sequenced has been decreased to 2. This spreadsheet serves as a minimal test for all boxes. 

#### `v5_spleen_plainHeaders.xlsx`

A version (not final) of the spleen preview dataset.
