graph_restriction:
    description: > 
        A JSON schema extension field used to specify which ontology terms are valid for a
         field, based on their graph location.  A graph consists of edges representing 
         classification (subClassOf) and simple existential restrictions 
         (e.g. eye subClassOf part_of some head).  Graph location is specified via a list 
         of objectProperties to follow and a list of grouping classes.  
         All ontologies and OWL entities are specified using CURIEs.  
         CURIE resolution depends on an extenal resolution service (e.g. identifiers.org) 
         or JSON-LD mapping file. 
    # Question: Should the mapping service or file be specified in schema?
    type: object
    required: [ontologies, relations, classes, include_self, direct] # we could potentially make relations optional if subClassOf-only is default.

        ontologies:
            description: > 
                A list of valid ontologies.  Each ontology is specified using a CURIE.

            items: string
    relations:
        description: > 
            A list of relations (object properties) to use for graph-based term grouping.  Each property is specified using a CURIE.

            Items: string

        description: > 
         A list of grouping classes.  Each class is specified using a CURIE

    include_self:
        description: > 
            A boolean allowing specification of whether the graph query should return the specified grouping classes(es).
        type: boolean
    direct:
        description: >
            A bolean specifying return of all descendant classes (False) or direct child classes only (True).
        type: boolean
